A simple application for monitoring your weight. In which you can enter your data to get the number of calories you can consume per day. Also, if you register, you will be able to track how many calories you have already consumed and how many more you can consume. You fill out a form in which you indicate what you ate and how many grams, and the application automatically calculates all the data
